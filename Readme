#Build

mvn clean package

#Pre requisite
1. AWS S3 accesskey
2. AWS S3 secretkey
3. AWS S3 bucket (Should already be present. Region is hardcoded to US_EAST_2)

#Startup Application
  java -Daws.s3.access.key=<> -Daws.s3.secret.key=<> -Daws.s3.bucket=<> -jar target/asset-uploader-1.0.jar

#Usage

1. curl localhost:8080/asset/{asset_id}?{timeout=100}
2. curl localhost:8080/assetlist
3. curl -XPUT localhost:8080/asset/{asset_id} -d'{"status":"ARCHIVED"}'
4. curl -XPOST localhost:8080/asset -F "data=@path/to/local/file"

#Assumption
1. There are only two kind of assets - Active, Archived.
2. An asset can only be Archived but can not be moved back to Active type.
3. No Delete option for any asset.
4. Hard limit supported by individual bucket.

#Design
1. Active assets are stored in bucket/Active/{asset_id}
2. Archived assets are stored in bucket/Archive/{asset_id}. Once copy is complete, asset is deleted from Active directory
3. All asset_id are generated timestamps at the time of upload.
